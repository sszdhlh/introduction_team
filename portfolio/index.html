        My intention with this concept is to help certain youngsters who are of playing age and want
        to play but can't find a
        local playground or a friend to play with. Therefore, the goal of my design for this app is to
        assist kids in finding the closest playground and pals they may play with. As a result, you
        won't have to stress about finding a playground to play at or finding other kids to play with
        when you want to have fun.

        The primary target group for this initiative is children between the ages of 0 and 12
        who are looking for the closest
        playground and buddies to visit an amusement park with.

        My concept was to develop an app that would help users meet friends if they went to the
        playground and found nobody
        to play with, as well as provide a route from their home to the closest playground. He can
        start a team event to reserve a friend for a specific playground so that other friends can
        participate once they learn about it. And make a personal page to save their preferred
        playgrounds so they can check the pertinent details at any time, then filter in their
        preferred list the next time they have time.

                During rapid design, what attracted me first was my love for plants and plants, and that I want to
                change transportation more convenient, and provide some convenience in life. I like to know different
                varieties of animals and plants, and have rich knowledge, but also like to protect animals and plants, I
                want to contribute to the protection of the environment. For the api for the school library viewing the
                location and the bus notification in various situations, I think it can bring practical help to me, so I
                like it very much. For the themes, I think these themes can be very good to facilitate life, contribute
                to the environment, and for the use of these types of databases and the use of the API interface, I
                think it can help more people to pay attention to these hot topics.

            <h2 style="text-align: justify">
                I believe that our design is seriously wrong because of the initially limited amount of time for rapid
                design. For instance, the target audience includes some kids who aren't sure what age they should be,
                and there are questions about features like whether to log in to use the software, whether the feature
                is too basic or too similar to Google Maps and how to effectively encourage kids to go outside and play.
                to do this, our team talked about adjustments that may be made for the target audience. The later
                website architecture can still be implemented and readily improved because the fundamental design has
                already been accomplished.

                The team group chose to give the development of two essential functions—finding playgrounds and starting
                team events—a priority when the prototype design was finished. Since I am the only backend engineer on
                our 45-person team, I wrote all of the logic code for the milestone release by myself. Our project is
                now capable of showing certain playgrounds on the home page. The map interface shows all playground
                sites and their details, and the ability to filter results by keyword is provided below. The first
                demonstration, however, did not include the implementation of the team event launch. We also demonstrate
                each of the features in turn in the demonstrations that follow.

                In the link, while not all of the functions have been implemented, we have done so for one crucial
                function—locating playgrounds. At the bottom of the page, users can browse playground locations and
                details as well as keyword filters. But not all of the features have been put into practice yet. The
                majority of users think that our website could be enhanced and are very interested in it. The tutor and
                the other group members simultaneously offered helpful ideas after hearing what was said. The one that
                emphasizes teamwork, in my opinion, is the most satisfying because everyone has improved greatly in
                terms of cooperation and task division. Additionally, I've become a better leader who can bring people
                together and let them play to their strengths.

                    I initially thought about and created the content that would be displayed on the website when
                    creating the portfolio. I then utilized HTML for the basic build and CSS to change the display
                    style. However, several unique effects, such as fading and lazy loading effects, make use of the
                    bootstrap framework and jQuery. Additionally, I used photographs that weren't mine to quote. The
                    portfolio's overall design may not completely satisfy me, but it is still a commendable effort that
                    will significantly influence how the project is designed and built in the future.

                daily life and daily life. If it is communication and teamwork, my personality will be more gentle. ,
                listen carefully to the opinions of team members, put forward some of your own opinions in time, and
                then summarize to the end. Of course, I also know very well the personality types of team members. Xiyao
                and Cheng Guo are both strong executives, and their tasks improve very quickly. They also actively
                exchange suggestions and discussions and are more outgoing. Xiao Zhou is more introverted, but he can
                stabilize himself on certain occasions. For example, when speaking, he will silently complete the
                document, ask some questions, and give some suggestions and feedback. For kai, he may not see people
                very often, but when the seminar comes, he is still more outgoing, but he may have more classes and
                sometimes seems sloppy.
                In the lecture, I learned various interesting knowledge points and the presentation of good projects,
                and wks played a very important role in the substantial structure of the website. Finally, I would like
                to thank the contacts for their help. In this process, not only testers help with user testing, but also
                real-time communication with the tutor. It is also very good for the progress of the complete project. I
                hope this time can be learned in future work. I will continue to work hard to give full play to my
